<h3>Bio</h3>

Details regarding my career path and skills can be found on my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varveyn/).

Back at my university years (2014-2019) I've been actively competing on various programming contests (ACM ICPC, Google Hash Code, etc.) and solving some algorithmic problems on my pastime (on platforms such as Codeforces, E-Olymp, Project Euler, etc.).

Since I've started to work, I've put a lot of efforts learning to write laconic, comprehensive and maintainable code. I feel aestetic pleasure from writing the code that is easy to read, understand and extend.

On my free time I enjoy long walks, watching movies, reading sci-fi novels, curious about economics and urban development.

<h3>Achievements</h3>
